# wp-privacy-policy-shortcodes
Adds shortcodes through which plugins can expose their privacy policy statements in a consistent fashion.

Proposed Shortcodes

* What data is collected from the user [privacy-what-personal-data-collected]
* What we do with the data / why the data is collected [privacy-why-personal-data-collected]
* Who the data is shared with (e.g. third-parties) [privacy-sharing-personal-data]
* Where the data is stored, how access to the data is protected [privacy-storing-personal-data]
* How long data is retained [privacy-retaining-personal-data]
* What options the user may have about data collection and use [privacy-user-options-personal-data]
* How the user can access, update, or delete the collected data [privacy-user-managing-personal-data]

Note: Intention is to get this eventually into WordPress core, possibly via the https://github.com/GDPRWP/GDPRWP-Plugin project
